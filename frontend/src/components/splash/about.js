      <p>Unshelvd is a social gaming site that does away with uncertainty at your next meetup amongst friends. Just let the site know how many people you have, what your interests include (or exclude), and Unshelvd will give you a list of the games to pull off the (virtual) shelf.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>It will give you suggestions for Connected (online) or Unplugged (in-person) games to play based on what's already on your shelf... or what you have in common with another user!</p>
